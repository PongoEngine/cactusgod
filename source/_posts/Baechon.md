excerpt: Lorainne sits in the driver seat of her compact car setting up a playlist. Creating playists is one of a growing set that she uses to pass the time. Pass the time. Why does she need to pass time. When sheâ€™s driving alone she always has to pass the time. Routine - Grab Keys. Open door. Sit down. Close door. Put keys in the ignition. Twist keys. Turn down the radio. Grab phone. Scroll. Scroll. Scroll. This early Tuesday morning she running behind but feeling extra she opens her booklet of IOUs and borrows ten minutes.

### Story
Lorainne sits in the driver seat of her compact car setting up a playlist. Creating playists is one of a growing set that she uses to pass the time. Pass the time. Why does she need to pass time. When she's driving alone she always has to pass the time. Routine - Grab Keys. Open door. Sit down. Close door. Put keys in the ignition. Twist keys. Turn down the radio. Grab phone. Scroll. Scroll. Scroll. This early Tuesday morning she running behind but feeling extra she opens her booklet of IOUs and borrows ten minutes.

Ten minutes pass to tweleve. Today feels like a distant morning. Whatever. She puts down her phone, puts the car in drive, and buckles her seat. Lorainne looks at her watch. Still late.

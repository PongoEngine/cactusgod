Verse1 is accompanied with just the bass drum and rhythm2 synth which highlights the vocals. The instruments build much like they did in the intro with additional layers and percussion.

The vocals are a softer but still carry that fuck you vibe. Rhythm1 builds much quicker as the song transitions to Bridge2. The only instruments playing are the bass drum, snare, and rhythm1 in its original state. The vocals are a softer but still carry that fuck you vibe. Rhythm1 builds much quicker as the song transitions to Bridge2.

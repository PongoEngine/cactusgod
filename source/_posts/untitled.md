### Simple intro
The intro beings with a single instrument that is highly effected with chorus and reverb. It plucks the notes of a chord in the first half of a measure and rests for the second half. Then in the next measure it plucks another chord using the same rhythm. The two measures repeat to make the intro.

### Sharp First Verse
The first verse hits hard with syncopated hip hop drums and rhythmic lyrics that dance on the down beat.

### Hello
Bridge1 is ghost like. Noise echos in the background. The only instruments playing are the bass drum, snare, and rhythm1 in its original state. The vocals are a softer but still carry that fuck you vibe. Rhythm1 builds much quicker as the song transitions to Bridge2.

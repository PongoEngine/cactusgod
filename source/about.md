Hello, my name is Jeremy but you may also know me as the "Cactus God." I am a programmer, musician, and lover of racing games. I started this blog to share solutions for developing haptics using limited telemetry data. I may also post about music synthesis.

I am constantly experimenting with and fine-tuning haptic details to enhance the depth of engagement in racing environments. I find joy in deciphering telemetry data, converting intricate code into lifelike sensations, and perfecting the blend of various audio signals to maximise immersion.

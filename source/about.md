### About Me
My name is Jeremy Meltingtallow and I wanted to be a rapper until 2005/6ish. I ended up studying computer science and became a game developer. I guess I'm not really a game developer anymore.

I don't know what I am or who I want to be but **I would like to make music again**.

The previous attemps at making music turned into a 4 bar fest. I'm hoping to go beyond the 4 bars by creating a set of technical documents that describe each song before I make it. A song will first be defined as a technical document. Once the document is completed the spec must not change in any way. There can be more than one song per document but they must all follow the specifications described in the document.

### About Writings
The writings will define basic elements of a song such as structure, scale, key, tempo, etc. Each writing may vary. They may get more complex or simple as this process gets refined.

### About Goal
My goal is to complete an album this year. My minimum requirements are 4 songs with an minimum average duration of 2 minutes and 55 seconds. The year is 2021.

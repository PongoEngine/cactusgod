Hello, my name is Jeremy, but you may also know me as the "Cactus God." I am a programmer and a sound engineer, but above all, I am an ardent enthusiast of racing simulators. I started this blog to share my passion for creating immersive experiences in racing games, where the elements of realism and simulation come alive in every sense of the word.

My journey began as a casual virtual racer but it didn't take me long to realize that my fascination wasn't just about gaming. I found myself dwelling deep into the workings of these racing simulators intrigued by their potential to recreate the feel of a real racing environment.

The thrill was in the details. In the pursuit of a perfect driving simulator. Be it the subtleties of haptic feedback or the art of simulating road noise, I ventured into an exciting journey of exploring the intricacies of these simulations and their auditory and tactile impressions.

I am constantly experimenting with and fine-tuning the audio and haptic details to enhance the depth of immersion in these simulated environments. I find immense joy in deciphering telemetry data, converting intricate code into lifelike sensations, and perfecting the blend of various audio signals to create a captivating soundscape.

With this blog, I aim to share my insights and findings with fellow enthusiasts and curious minds. I believe in the power of collaborative learning, and I hope to ignite discussions, inspire innovation, and foster a shared passion for immersive racing simulations. Whether you're an avid gamer, a developer, a sound engineer, or simply someone fascinated by the intricacies of simulation, I invite you to journey with me on this exciting ride.

Let's push the boundaries of our virtual racetracks together.

Welcome to the Cactus God.

Hello, my name is Jeremy, but you may also know me as the "Cactus God." I am a programmer and a sound engineer, but above all, I am an ardent enthusiast of racing simulators. I started this blog to share my passion for creating immersive experiences in racing games, where the elements of realism and simulation come alive in every sense of the word.

I am constantly experimenting with and fine-tuning the audio and haptic details to enhance the depth of immersion in these simulated environments. I find joy in deciphering telemetry data, converting intricate code into lifelike sensations, and perfecting the blend of various audio signals to create a captivating soundscape.

With this blog I aim to share my insights and findings with fellow enthusiasts and curious minds.

Welcome to the Cactus God.

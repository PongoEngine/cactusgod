title: Attributes

Attributes are used to specify a song. Some attributes are required for each song. Some attributes are optional. Attributes differ from songs in that they can change over time. An attribute may become more specific or loose. It may also become optional, required, or removed from this list. Attributes can also be added over time. This page is used a quick reference for both myself and anyone else who may visit this domain.

### Required: 
All required attributes must be included when describing a musical document. A required attribute may be omitted if and only if a song has been created before the attribute has become required.

#### Story
The story is defined using DAN HARMON's STORY CIRCLE.
1. You — A character is in a zone of comfort,
2. Need — But they want something.
3. Go — They enter an unfamiliar situation,
4. Search — Adapt to it,
5. Find — Get what they wanted, 
6. Take — Pay a heavy price for it, 
7. Return — Then return to their familiar situation, 
8. Change — Having changed.

#### Structure
The structure refers to the organization of a song using a combination of different sections. A section can be but not limited to an intro, verse, chorus, bridge, and outro.

#### Scale
In music theory, a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch. A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a descending scale. The scale may change multiple times in a song.

#### Key
The key of a piece is the group of pitches, or scale, that forms the basis of a music composition in classical, Western art, and Western pop music. The key may change multiple times in a song.

#### Tempo
Tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece. The tempo may change multiple times in a song.

* Larghissimo – very, very slow (24 bpm and under)
* Adagissimo – very slow
* Grave – very slow (25–45 bpm)
* Largo – slow and broad (40–60 bpm)
* Lento – slow (45–60 bpm)
* Larghetto – rather slow and broad (60–66 bpm)
* Adagio – slow with great expression (66–76 bpm)
* Adagietto – slower than andante (72–76 bpm) or slightly faster than adagio (70–80 bpm)
* Andante – at a walking pace (76–108 bpm)
* Andantino – slightly faster than andante (although, in some cases, it can be taken to mean slightly slower than andante) (80–108 bpm)
* Marcia moderato – moderately, in the manner of a march (83–85 bpm)
* Andante moderato – between andante and moderato (thus the name) (92–112 bpm)
* Moderato – at a moderate speed (108–120 bpm)
* Allegretto – by the mid-19th century, moderately fast (112–120 bpm)
* Allegro moderato – close to, but not quite allegro (116–120 bpm)
* Allegro – fast, quick, and bright (120–156 bpm) (molto allegro is slightly faster than allegro, but always in its range; 124-156 bpm)
* Vivace – lively and fast (156–176 bpm)
* Vivacissimo – very fast and lively (172–176 bpm)
* Allegrissimo or Allegro vivace – very fast (172–176 bpm)
* Presto – very, very fast (168–200 bpm)
* Prestissimo – even faster than presto (200 bpm and over)

#### Time Signature
The time signature is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are contained in each measure (bar), and which note value is equivalent to a beat.

### Optional: 
An optional attribute does not need to be included in a musical document.

#### Lyrics
Lyrics are rooted from the story. If lyrics are present in a song they do not need to completely tell the story.

#### Dynamics
Dynamics are one of the expressive elements of music. Used effectively, dynamics help musicians sustain variety and interest in a musical performance, and communicate a particular emotional state or feeling.

Attributes are used to specify a song. Some attributes are required for each song. Some attributes are optional. Attributes differ from songs in that they can change over time. An attribute may become more specific or loose. It may also become optional, required, or removed from this list. Attributes can also be added over time. This page is used a quick reference for both myself and anyone else who may visit this domain.

### Required: 
A required attribute must when describing a musical document. A required attribute may be omitted if and only if a song has been created before the attribute has become required.

#### Story
The story is defined using DAN HARMON's STORY CIRCLE.
1. You — A character is in a zone of comfort,
2. Need — But they want something.
3. Go — They enter an unfamiliar situation,
4. Search — Adapt to it,
5. Find — Get what they wanted, 
6. Take — Pay a heavy price for it, 
7. Return — Then return to their familiar situation, 
8. Change — Having changed.

#### Structure
The structure refers to the organization of a song using a combination of different sections. A section can be but not limited to an intro, verse, chorus, bridge, and outro.

#### Scale
In music theory, a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch. A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a descending scale. The scale may change multiple times in a song.

#### Key
The key of a piece is the group of pitches, or scale, that forms the basis of a music composition in classical, Western art, and Western pop music. The key may change multiple times in a song.
